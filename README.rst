Django application providing queryset sealing capability to force appropriate usage of ``only()``/``defer()`` and
``select_related()``/``prefetch_related()``.

Installation
------------

.. code:: sh

    pip install django-seal

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    # models.py
    from django.db import models
    from seal.models import SealableModel

    class Location(SealableModel):
        latitude = models.FloatField()
        longitude = models.FloatField()

    class SeaLion(SealableModel):
        height = models.PositiveIntegerField()
        weight = models.PositiveIntegerField()
        location = models.ForeignKey(Location, models.CASCADE, null=True)
        previous_locations = models.ManyToManyField(Location, related_name='previous_visitors')

By default ``UnsealedAttributeAccess`` warnings will be raised on sealed objects attributes accesses

.. code:: python

    >>> location = Location.objects.create(latitude=51.585474, longitude=156.634331)
    >>> sealion = SeaLion.objects.create(height=1, weight=100, location=location)
    >>> sealion.previous_locations.add(location)
    >>> SeaLion.objects.only('height').seal().get().weight
    UnsealedAttributeAccess:: Attempt to fetch deferred field "weight" on sealed <SeaLion instance>.
    >>> SeaLion.objects.seal().get().location
    UnsealedAttributeAccess: Attempt to fetch related field "location" on sealed <SeaLion instance>.
    >>> SeaLion.objects.seal().get().previous_locations.all()
    UnsealedAttributeAccess: Attempt to fetch many-to-many field "previous_locations" on sealed <SeaLion instance>.

You can `elevate the warnings to exceptions by filtering them`_. This is useful to assert no unsealed attribute accesses are
performed when running your test suite for example.

.. code:: python

    >>> import warnings
    >>> from seal.exceptions import UnsealedAttributeAccess
    >>> warnings.filterwarnings('error', category=UnsealedAttributeAccess)
    >>> SeaLion.objects.only('height').seal().get().weight
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    UnsealedAttributeAccess:: Attempt to fetch deferred field "weight" on sealed <SeaLion instance>.
    >>> SeaLion.objects.seal().get().location
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    UnsealedAttributeAccess: Attempt to fetch related field "location" on sealed <SeaLion instance>.
    >>> SeaLion.objects.seal().get().previous_locations.all()
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    UnsealedAttributeAccess: Attempt to fetch many-to-many field "previous_locations" on sealed <SeaLion instance>.

Or you can `configure logging to capture warnings`_ to log unsealed attribute accesses to the ``py.warnings`` logger which is a
nice way to identify and address unsealed attributes accesses from production logs without taking your application down if some
instances happen to slip through your battery of tests.

.. code:: python

    >>> import logging
    >>> logging.captureWarnings()
